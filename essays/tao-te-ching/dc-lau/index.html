the refuge for the myriad creatures.<br> It is that by which the good man protects,<br> And that by which the bad is protected. <p>Beautiful words when offered will win high rank in return;<br> Beautiful deeds can raise a man above others. <p>Even if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned? <p>Hence when the emperor is set up and the three ducal ministers are appointed, he who makes a present of the way without stirring from his seat is preferable to one who offers presents of jade disks followed by a team of four horses.<br> Why was this way valued of old?<br> Was it not said that

sage never attempts to be great that he succeeds in becoming great. <p>One who makes promises rashly rarely keeps good faith;<br> One who is in the habit of considering things easy meets with frequent
