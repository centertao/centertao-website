Chapter 2 sheds light. The “<em>good</em>” is the same character (善 <em>shàn</em>) in both chapter 2 and 8. Chapter 2 notes, <em><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-2/>All realizing goodness as goodness, no goodness already</a>.</em> The dipolar reality we see (good <strong>vs</strong>. bad, etc.) is a function of our nervous system. See <a href=/2009/04/19/yin-yang-natures-hoodwink/>Yin Yang, Nature’s Hoodwink</a>. Even so, the uniquely “good” characteristic of water is that it <em>reaches great conformity</em>. That makes water a fitting metaphor for <em>profound moral character</em>. As chapter 65 observes… <p><a href=ttp://www.centertao.org/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-65/>Always investigate the patterns.<br> That is called<strong> profound moral character</strong>.<br> Moral character, profound indeed, distant indeed!<br> To the outside world, contrary indeed.<br> Then, and only then, <strong>reaching great conformity</strong>.</a> <p><strong><em>Water benefits all things and does not contend</em></strong> <p>It helps to consider deeply the nature of <em>benefits</em> and <em>benevolence,</em> i.e., line 6’s <em>In intention, satisfactory is depth and benevolence.</em> Viewed from a very personal point of view, <em>benefit</em> and <em>benevolence</em> will always be interpreted as that which makes ‘me’ personally feel best… <em>benefits</em> my personal life as I subjectively see it. For example, if as a child I fall down and hurt myself, any parent that rushes in to help me is offering <em>benevolence</em> and <em>benefit</em>… at least that is how it appears from the child’s point of view, or anyone who projects their own personal well-being onto the child. That is narrowly focused empathy. A broader and <em>contrary</em> view suggests that the long-term <em>benefit</em> might be to allow the child to feel the full impact of his mistake, and thereby gain deeper insight into his own future actions. Of course, I’m not talking life-threatening mistakes, just minor stuff. Even so, we learn through all of our mistakes, minor to major, from the stumbling as a child on up. Circumventing life’s lessons invites unintended consequences, as any impartial survey of civilization demonstrates. <p><strong><em>Dwells in places the multitude loathe</em></strong> <p>It helps to note that “<em>dwell</em>” is fundamentally a matter of perception for any animal capable of awareness. I assume that spans every creature from amoeba to humans. In other words, after you die, you won’t <em>loathe</em> where you <em>dwell</em>. To gain a deeper appreciation of <em>Dwells in places the multitude loathe</em> consider the experience of chickens raised for human consumption — listen to <a href=https://www.npr.org/2019/06/17/733456435/pets-pests-and-food-our-complex-contradictory-attitudes-toward-animals>Pets, Pests And Food: Our Complex, Contradictory Attitudes Toward Animals</a>. For the particular chicken example, listen to minute 33 to 38. Most people would rather remain blissfully ignorant of <em>loathsome places</em> like this. Moral character and blissful ignorance are like oil and water. <p>Unlike other species, the human “problem” lies in our imagined perceptions, and in how we project our own personal fears and needs onto the world we perceive. That would not be as serious a problem if we realized that we truly don’t know what we think we know. As chapter 71 cautions, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-71/>Realizing I don’t’ know is better; not knowing this knowing is disease</a>. That not being the case, we see the world as a reality in its own right, rather than merely a projection of our own fears and needs. <p>The ‘engine’ that allows that perception is our own brain. Its processes determine what we perceive. The huge gap between our biological reality and the imagined reality it creates is quite overwhelming, and naturally so. No animal evolves to second guess its own perceived version of reality. It is quite amazing that we can even attempt to “<em>nearly rise beyond ourselves</em>”. As chapter 52 observes… <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-52/>All under heaven had a beginning; consider the origin of all under heaven.<br> Already having this origin, use this to know its offspring.<br> Already knowing its offspring, return to observe the origin.<br> Nearly rising beyond oneself.<br> Squeeze exchange, shut the gates; to the end, oneself diligent.<br> Open the exchange, help its affairs; to the end, oneself no relief.<br> Seeing the small is called clarity, abide yielding is called powerful.<br> Use the light, and again return to clarity, not offer oneself misfortune.<br> This serves as practicing of the constant.</a> <p>The Bhagavad Gita sheds light on perception that <em>Dwells in places the multitude loathe.</em> Note how eager Arjuna is to perceive the big picture, and then how joyful he is to leave that experience and return to normal human perception. <blockquote><p>11:4 If thou thinkest, O my Lord, that it can be seen by me, show me, O God of Yoga, the glory of thine own Supreme Being. <p>11:23 But the worlds also behold thy fearful mighty form, with many mouths and eyes, with many bellies, thighs and feet, frightening with terrible teeth: they tremble in fear, and I also tremble. <p>11:25 Like the fire at the end of Time which burns all in the last day, I see thy vast mouths and thy terrible teeth. Where am I? Where is my shelter? Have mercy on me. God of gods, Refuge Supreme of the world! <p>11:45 In a vision I have seen what no man has seen before: I rejoice in exultation, and yet my heart trembles with fear. Have mercy upon me, Lord of gods, Refuge of the whole universe: show me again thine own human form.</blockquote> <p>The uncomfortable view of life, the world and how it ‘actually is’, is what the <em>multitude loathe</em>. We seek a view that soothes our emotions, i.e., fear and need. We want a comfortable story that lulls us to sleep, so to speak. The Taoist view, however, <em>Dwells in places the multitude loathe</em>. Is it any wonder why the Taoist point of view never became a genuine worldwide religion? No “opiate for the masses” here. <p><strong><em>In being, satisfactory is earthy</em></strong> <p>This harkens to the idea of “keeping your feet on the ground”. The more grounded I feel, the more <em>satisfactory</em> all outcomes of my <em>being</em> become. When I lose <em>earthy</em>, I feel too much adrift in the unknown. Such insecurity spawns needs and fears that drive me to unsatisfactory reactions. <p><strong><em>In intention, satisfactory is depth and benevolence</em></strong> <p>Frankly, nature’s <em>benevolence</em> and <em>benefit</em> is quite different from human expectations and virtues. As this excerpt from chapter 38 hints, <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-38/>Hence, Virtue follows loss of way.<br> Benevolence follows loss of virtue.<br> Justice follows loss of benevolence.<br> Ritual follows loss of justice.</a> <p>Or even more bluntly… <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-5/>The universe is not benevolent,<br> and all things serve as grass dogs (‘sacrificial lambs’).<br> The wise person is not benevolent,<br> and the people serve as grass dogs.</a> <p>Feeling maximum empathy and compassion, yet as chapter 10 says, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-10/>Loving the nation, can you govern the people without acting?</a> Empathy drives our actions in proportion to how seriously we take ourselves, i.e., in “helping” others we are simply helping ourselves vicariously, so to speak. You know… our naturally meddling <a href=https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/do_mirror_neurons_give_empathy>mirror neurons</a>. That could be another heretical reality the <em>multitude</em> <em>loathe</em>. And now to return to chapter 38&#8230; <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-38/>Superior virtue never acts and never believes.<br> Inferior virtue never acts yet believes.<br> Superior benevolence acts yet never believes.<br> Superior justice acts and believes.<br> Superior etiquette acts but when none respond,<br> Normally roles up sleeves and throws.</a> <p>From a Taoist point of view, it is clear that action can often, if not mostly, be problematic. Why? Because our own personal agenda—fear and need—drive our actions and reactions. No wonder chapter 3 advises <em>wéi wú wéi </em>(为无为)… <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-3/><strong>Doing without doing</strong>, following without exception rules</a>, and chapter 48’s <em>wú wéi </em>(无为)… <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-48/><strong>Without doing</strong>, yet not undone</a>. <p>Nonetheless, the story we tell ourselves is one of our actions helping to solve problems. As that proverb puts it, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions”. As chapter 16 concludes… <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-16/>Not knowing the constant, rash actions lead to ominous results.<br> Knowing the constant allows, allowing therefore impartial,<br> Impartial therefore whole, whole therefore natural,<br> Natural therefore the way.<br> The way therefore long enduring, nearly rising beyond oneself.</a> <p><strong><em>In speech, satisfactory is truth</em></strong> <p>This offers insight into chapter 56’s, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-56/>Knowing doesn’t speak; speaking doesn’t know</a>. After all, the <em>multitude</em> do tend to “shoot the messenger”. So, what does <em>truth</em> actually mean? Does not silence serve as the foundation of <em>truth</em>? As chapter 25 hints, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-25/>The outside world passes for the beginning of Heaven and Earth. <strong>Still and silent,</strong> it alone does not change</a>. <p>Best be very careful with speech as these passages also suggest… <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-5/>More speech counts as exceptionally limited; not in accord with keeping to the middle.</a> #5<br> <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-23/>Infrequent speech is natural.</a> #23<br> <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-27/>Adept at speech without the flaw of banishment and blame</a>. #27<br> <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-45/>Great debate seems slow in speech.</a> #45<br> <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-70/>Speech has its faction, involvement has its sovereign</a>. #72<br> <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-81/>True speech isn’t beautiful, Beautiful speech isn’t true. </a> #81 <p><strong><em>In honesty, satisfactory is order.<br> In work, satisfactory is ability.<br> In action, satisfactory is time.</em></strong> <p><em>Honesty</em>, <em>work</em>, and <em>action</em> are very much inter-related and it all begins with <em>honesty</em>. Chapter 33 observes <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-33/>Knowing self is honesty</a> and chapter 55 adds <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-55/>Knowing the constant is called clear and honest.</a> Any <em>action</em> or <em>work</em> that results from a diminished sense of the <em>constant</em> easily leads to chaos and dead ends, as chapter 16 warned, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-16/>Not knowing the constant, rash actions lead to ominous results</a>. <p>A good question to ask now is what impedes our <em>knowing the constant</em>? In a word—<strong>Fear</strong>! Fear, and all the emotional forces that channel our fear, blinds us to any perceptions that would otherwise help us to <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-16/>nearly rising beyond oneself</a>. Maintaining a presence of “mind” is key to <em>ability</em> and how we react in <em>time</em>. I use the term mind loosely, because this in-the-moment awareness is an essential factor in the survival of all life, e.g., the “dreaming” rabbit gets caught by the coyote. We are rabbits. <p><strong><em>He alone does not contend,<br> Hence, there is no blame.</em></strong> <p>Deeply accepting the fact that fear moves all life, and that no living thing has any <u>true</u> control over fear, makes it impossible to <em>contend</em> with either others or myself. In truly having no choice, no free will, any attempt to <em>blame</em> anyone for either their “intentional” bad or good deeds is an oxymoron of sorts. <p>Of course, biologically speaking, <em>blame</em> is a social response that keeps the wheels of interaction between members of social species turning. In non-thinking animals, <em>contention</em> and <em>blame</em> occurs spontaneously in-the-moment. The dogs fight and peace resumes at some point. For humans, perceptions of <em>blame</em> can endure in our imagination persistently. We tend to feel convinced that those perceptions are true in their own right, and not simply projections of our own fears and needs. Again, as chapter 71 cautions, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-71/>Realizing I don’t’ know is better; not knowing this knowing is disease</a>. <p style="text-align: center;">Video Archive <a href=https://youtu.be/KmH4VdFpXrc>https://youtu.be/KmH4VdFpXrc</a> <h2 class="three ttc-pass">Third Pass: <q>Chapter of the Month</q> <time>03/21/2017</time></h2> <h3>Corrections?</h3> <p>None this time <h3>Reflections:</h3> <p><em>Highest good is like water.<br> Water benefits all things and does not contend,<br> Dwells in places the multitude loathe.<br> Therefore, it is somewhat like the way</em>. <p>Water has no agenda, no preferences that sully its intentions. Hypocrisy comes to mind. When I’m not pushing for my own agenda or preferences, I can be impartial and honest. As soon as my agenda triggers emotion, I set about cleverly rationalizing why my preferences are justified. <p>This is completely natural, of course, with us usually unaware of most of it. It flies below our cognitive radar. The only time we really notice it is when it is happening in other people — those hypocrites 😉 As I age, I am increasing aware of this natural <a href=/blog/2010/04/11/how-the-hoodwink-hooks/>bio-hoodwink</a>. <p><em>In being, satisfactory is earthy.</em> I feel this as keeping my feet on the ground or being grounded. This shows it is just as difficult to be satisfactorily grounded today as it was back then. Of course, that was only 2 to 3000 years ago, and recent history vis-à-vis <strong><a href=/2017/01/04/the-tradeoff/>The Tradeoff</a></strong>. <p><em>In intention, satisfactory is depth and benevolence</em>. This addresses the problem of how our preferences — our agendas — sully our intentions. It requires some depth of mind to realize the unsatisfactory nature of such bias. While its satisfactory in the short-term, not so in the long-term. <p><em>In speech, satisfactory is truth</em>. Truth and trust go hand in hand, and trust is the jewel that maintains close relationships. However, too much truth can be problematic as the next line addresses. <p><em>In honesty, satisfactory is order</em>. If you are too bluntly honest, chaos easily ensues. That’s why they say silence is golden. This reminds me of chapter 26’s <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-26/>The still is the ruler of the restless</a>. <p><em>In work, satisfactory is ability</em>. Being competent in whatever your work is what counts — not the kind of work or profession. The following are verses from the Bhagavad Gita that correspond to and expand on this. Particularly 18:47. <strong>Note</strong>: It helps to take a Taoist view of God to plumb the deepest meaning from the Bhagavad Gita. As chapter 4 hints, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-4/>It resembles the ancestor of the Supreme Being.</a> In other words, don’t let the word get in the way of this ‘resembles the ancestor’ mystery. <blockquote><p>4:14 In the bonds of works I am free, because in them I am free from desires. The man who can see this truth. In his work he finds his freedom. <p>4:24 Who in all his work sees God, he in truth goes unto God: God is his worship, God is his offering, offered by God in the fire of God. <p>6:1 He who works not for an earthly reward but does the work to be done, he is a Sanyasi, he is a Yogi: not he who lights not the sacred fire or offers not the holy sacrifice. <p>13:29 He who sees that all work, everywhere, is only the work of nature; and that the Spirit watches this work ‑ he see the truth. <p>18:12 When work is done for a reward, the work brings pleasure, or pain, or both, in its time; but when a man does work in Eternity, then Eternity is his reward. <p>18:47 Greater is thine own work, even if this be humble, than the work of another, even if this be great. When a man does the work God gives him, no sin can touch this man</blockquote> <p><em>In action, satisfactory is time</em>. Patience is a virtue that makes action always less dangerous. <p><em>He alone does not contend, Hence, there is no blame</em>. Personally, I find the blame-game begins within, and then projected outward onto suitable scapegoats to unload some of that burden. We contend with ourselves in that we harbor ideals of how life should be that conflict with the reality — how things are! The battle we wage is internal; the collateral damage happens when we vent our frustrations. <p>All this reminds me of chapter 44, <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-44/>Name and body, which is intimate.<br> Body and goods, which is excessive.<br> Gain and loss, which is defective.<br> Therefore, the more we love, the greater the cost.<br> The more we hold on, the deeper the loss.<br> Knowing contentment, never dishonorable.<br> Knowing when to stop, never dangerous.<br> Then you can long endure.</a> <p>This also reminded me of the last section of a post I made on water — <a href=/2011/02/14/water-water-everywhere-but%e2%80%a6/>Water in Mind</a>. It may offer food for contemplating mind as you watch the moment-to-moment of thought (or silent awareness) flow into the void of time. <p><strong>A Philosophical Side to Water</strong> <p>I can&#8217;t let a whole post go by without an ‘Observation’, now can I? Water has long been a fitting spiritual metaphor. Here&#8217;s an angle which I&#8217;ve never seen used&#8230; <p><em>Thought is like water flowing into bottomless space </em>— the silent and void. To paraphrase chapter 5, <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-5>Much thought leads inevitably to silence. Better to hold fast to the void</a>. This sounds good in principle. Alas, the brain has a mind of its own and thought can&#8217;t help but trickle down into its neural space. After all, nature abhors a vacuum. Space just attracts stuff, whether empty shelves, open fields, or trillions of synapses ready and waiting to fire. They estimate that to be between 100 trillion and 1,000 trillion synapses. The process of the mind filling up this synaptic space may be what produces the illusion of time itself. Indeed, when I cease to think, for the short time I&#8217;m able, time stands still. That is what I know to be eternity. <h2 class="ttc-pass two">Second Pass: <q>Work in Progress</q> <time>1/17/2013</time></h2> <h3>Issues:</h3> <p>Some <strong>lines</strong> of this chapter (<strong>5~10</strong>) are three character sentences with the middle serving as a cross between a verb and an adjective, as I see it. This middle word is <i>shàn </i>(善) meaning: <i>good, satisfactory, good deed, good and honest, good (virtuous), wise, benevolent, well-disposed, kind, friendly, make a success of, perfect, be good at, be expert in, be adept in, properly, be apt to, to improve or perfect</i>. I decided <b>satisfactory is </b>conveys the spirit best. Satisfactory speaks to a sense of compromise, which I see expressed throughout nature. I can&#8217;t help but feel it is too bad we humans couldn&#8217;t model this aspect of nature&#8217;s way a little better, i.e., we tend to expect too much, and offer too little in return. Of course, in the wild this is satisfactory! <p>This<i> satisfactory-ness</i> first appears in <strong>line 5</strong>. I first changed it to read, <i>In being, <b>satisfactory </b><b>is</b> location. </i>I took <i> Being </i> from <i> jū </i>(居):<i> reside; dwell; live; residence; house; be (in a certain position); occupy (a certain place); store up; lay by; stay put; be at a stand still</i>. This usage is a little odd considering the modern context of <i>jū.</i> D.C. Lau translated this line as, <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-8>In a home it is the site that matters</a>. His is certainly true, but not as useful to me as model for living, or at least understanding, which I think the Tao Te Ching aims for. <p>My problem may be that I took <i>location</i> from <i>dì </i>(地): <i>the earth; land; soil; fields; ground; place; locality. </i>The truer way to put this, for me, would be: <i>In being, satisfactory is being grounded.</i> It is just that I&#8217;m not keen on using <i>being</i> twice. Perhaps I should say, <i>In being, satisfactory is grounded (or earthy)?</i> Oh heck with it… I will. <i>Location</i> just doesn&#8217;t have &#8216;heart&#8217;, unless <strong>line 5</strong> is interpreted as D.C. Lau does. <p>Line 10 is interesting. I always liked how D.C. Lau put it: <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-8>In action it is timeliness that matters</a>. He derives <i>timeliness</i> from<i> Shí</i> (时): <i>time; times; days; fixed time; hour; season; current; present; opportunity</i>. I might prefer <i>present</i> (i.e., <i>being present</i>) over <i>timeliness</i>. Plunging in even deeper, I feel that <i>time</i> really encompasses more. Sometimes words, like <i>being present</i>, get overused. Returning to the root can help. <h3>Commentary:</h3> <p>This chapter really zeros in on core things that matter in life. I do translate this series of &#8216;matters&#8217; differently than D.C.Lau does. Not better, though, just a little different angle on some of them. Taking both translations together adds depth to each for me. I especially like <a href=/essays/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-8/It%20is%20because%20it%20does%20not%20contend%20that%20it%20is%20never%20at%20fault.>In government it is order that matters</a>, yet the literal Chinese doesn&#8217;t really say government. Nevertheless, it is true, as history shows! Indeed, that is the main function of civilization; that and optimizing comfort and security, of course. <p><i>He alone does not contend, Hence there is no blame</i> is interesting. These two, <i>contending</i> and <i>blaming</i> (or <i>fault</i> as D.C. Lau puts it) are profoundly, albeit subtly, connected. <i>Blaming</i>, whether directed inward as guilt or outward as blame, seems connected to our sense of fairness (the fairness &#8216;gene&#8217;). <i>Contending, </i>whether inward with our self-image or outward socially, seems connected to our sense of survival (the survival &#8216;gene&#8217;). This impetus drives &#8216;me first&#8217;, or by social extension, &#8216;my group first&#8217;. These two serve opposing needs: a need to have a level, fair, playing field on one hand, and the need to win, and rise to the top of the heap. No wonder we have so much difficulty &#8216;figuring out life&#8217;; we driven in two opposing directions. <p>Diminishing the contending side, i.e., <i>He alone does not contend, </i>would naturally diminish the blaming side, i.e., <i>Hence there is no blame</i>. Of course, putting this into practice is another matter… <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-70/>Our words are very easy to know, very easy to do.<br> Under heaven none can know, none can do.</a> <p>But, putting it into practice is really only secondary. Understanding that this is happening is extremely useful because the rest follows naturally in time. Sure, the fly in the ointment is always, <i>under heaven none can know</i> and <a href=/blog/2012/03/20/we-only-understand-what-we-know>we can only truly understand that which we know</a>. But, I find that even a superficial understanding moderates my our look. There is no need to be perfect! <i>Satisfactory</i> suffices. Besides, that is the benefit of aging; as the decades roll on, visceral <i>knowing</i> steadily deepens. <h3>Suggested Revision:</h3> <p><i>Highest good is like water.<br> Water benefits all things and does not contend,<br> Dwells in places the multitude loathe.<br> Therefore it is somewhat like the way.<br> In being, <b>satisfactory </b><b>is</b> <b>earthy</b>.<br> In intention, <b>satisfactory </b><b>is</b> depth and benevolence.<br> In speech, <b>satisfactory </b><b>is</b> truth.<br> In honesty, <b>satisfactory </b><b>is</b> order.<br> In work, <b>satisfactory </b><b>is</b> ability.<br> In action, <b>satisfactory </b><b>is</b> <b>time.<br> </b>He alone does not contend,<br> Hence, there is no blame.</i> <h2 class="one ttc-pass">First Pass: <q>Chapter of the Week</q> <time>12/12/2008</time></h2> <p>Also, <em>water is somewhat like the way </em>in that it <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-66>excels in taking the lower position</a>. Given our hierarchical biology (nature), the lower position is also a <em>place the multitude loathe to dwell.</em> That is, unless everyone is down there to keep us company. <p>Why do we so easily become ungrounded and complicate the simple? Personally, it always comes down to biting off more than I can chew. Just spiting &#8216;it&#8217; out works well, it is just bringing myself to spit &#8216;it&#8217; out that&#8217;s difficult. Of course, that&#8217;s alright for <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-63>even the sage treats some things as difficult</a>. If that&#8217;s true of the sage, then that certainly lets everyone off the hook, yes? <p>Now for a look at those rules of thumb below. <ul type=disc><li><em>In being, good is earth:</em> I could also read that as &#8216;being grounded is good&#8217;. The foundation is most important. If that is wobbly everything built upon it inherits that instability. That is why I finally had to examine the words with which I think (see <a href=/essays/correlations/>correlations</a>). Of course now everything is wobbly 😉 </ul> <ul type=disc><li><em>In intention, good is depth and benevolence: </em> <em>Xin</em> (心), the actual Chinese word here, translates as mind, emotion, feeling, intention, core, etc. I wonder if we don&#8217;t tend to put much more stock in &#8216;thinking&#8217; than &#8216;feeling&#8217;? As I see it, it is the &#8216;feelings&#8217; at our core that directs and drives our &#8216;thinking&#8217;. Benevolent emotions results in benevolent thoughts and actions. Disturbed emotions result in disturbed thoughts and actions. Who determines the emotions we feel? Personally, I&#8217;ve never decided to feel a particular emotion, emotions well up from deep inside and visit my awareness. Although, I do have a hand in fanning or dampening those flames. </ul> <ul type=disc><li><em>In speech, good is truth:</em> I know (viscerally) that truth works best. I reckon it is the promise of short term gain that pushes us to bend the truth. In the end, the unintended consequences of that are long term loss. That&#8217;s a <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-52>by-path</a> as I see it. I much prefer the other way: short term loss, with the &#8216;unintended consequence&#8217; of long term gain. Now that&#8217;s a buy low &#8211; sell high strategy that works! </ul> <ul type=disc><li><em>In honesty, good is order:</em> Be honest up to the point where order is impaired. Then be silent. The Japanese are very skilled in this, which often drives Westerns nuts. As for me, I&#8217;ve found this advice exceptionally useful. </ul> <ul type=disc><li><em>In work, good is ability:</em> As my mother always said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you do, just do it well&#8221;. And ability comes from paying as close attention to the work I&#8217;m doing at the moment. That ties right in with this last point. </ul> <ul type=disc><li><em>In action, good is present:</em> Being present, moment to moment makes all action sacred action. The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita>Bhagavad Gita</a> refers to this as &#8216;consecrated action&#8217;. It is the core principle in yoga. &#8216;Yoking&#8217; one&#8217;s attention (presence of mind, watchfulness, mindfulness, etc.) to the task at hand. Personally, this is the holy grail of consciousness. Talk about biting off more than I can chew! </ul></div> <div class="now-what to-dclau"><a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-8>Go to <em>D.C.
