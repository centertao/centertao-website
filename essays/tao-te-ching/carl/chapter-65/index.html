The shorter first part of the meeting begins with a chapter reading followed by attendees’ <u>commentary</u>, if any. A little later on begins the longer <u>open discussion</u> part of the meeting when those who wish to discuss how the chapter relates to their personal experience. <h3>Corrections?</h3> <p>Nothing this time. <h3>Reflections</h3> <p><strong><em>Of ancients adept in the way, none ever use it to enlighten people,<br> They will use it in order to fool them.</em></strong> <p>I’ve interpreted this in various ways over the decades. Early on, I saw this as saying that <em>ancients adept in the way</em> intentionally <em>use it in order to fool </em>people. That never felt correct, so I thought perhaps those ancients didn’t know they were doing this. In other words, the ancients were drinking their own ‘kool aid’. This still seems a reasonable interpretation. Yet, now I see this more realistically in a couple of ways… <p><strong>First</strong>: People only truly understand what they already intuitively know. (See <u><a href=/blog/2012/03/20/we-only-understand-what-we-know>We only understand what we already know</a></u>). People interpret what they see or hear relative to their own level of “maturity” (for lack of a better word). Frankly, the world we see is a reflection of ourselves, our biases, our fears, our expectations. Thus, regardless of how <em>enlightened</em> the message is, people will skew it to reflect the reality they know, and consequently become <em>fooled</em> by their misinterpretation. History is full of example of such misinterpretation, especially in relation to religions. Indeed, religions <u>never</u> adhere to the founding message of their prophets, but devolve into institutions that more of less reflect the ‘public mind’. <p>More broadly, misinterpreting each other is very common. I assume everyone has experienced this a few times at least. You say something, which in your mind feels innocuous, but the person hearing it ‘takes it the wrong way’. That is because they are hearing what you say through their own set of filters, e.g., needs, fears, expectations, worries, desires, beliefs, moral values. Of course, you’ve undoubtedly been on the hearing end of this interaction as well. <p>Why don’t we realize we’re misreading each other? Because we invariably tend to<u> believe we perceive reality</u>… and naturally so. This belief is the <em>disease</em> all humans share as chapter 71 bluntly points out… <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-71/>Realizing I don’t know is better; not knowing this knowing is disease</a>. The next three lines of this chapter also allude to this <em>disease</em>. <p><strong>Second</strong>: We are all human animals, not so different in deeper ways than each other. Anyone <em>adept in the way</em> still deals with the same primary instincts and emotions as everyone else. However, people yearning for a heroic spiritual ‘alpha male’ ascribe wondrous powers to a charismatic personality, which then embodies their yearning. It is all in the eye of the beholder. If the devotee’s eye sees a hero, then hero it is. The fooling aspect isn’t an intentional act on the part of the “hero”. Yet, the “hero” would find it difficult, even impossible, to dissuade the devotee’s hero-belief because the devotee’s emotions are creating this reality. <p>More broadly, ‘we can only understand what we intuitively know’ means that a teacher is always <em>fooling them</em>&#8230; <em>them</em> being any student seeking insight. In a way, if a teacher knows this deeper layer, then he knows he is <em>fooling them</em>, as opposed to a teacher who actually believes he/she either knows the “truth” or can convey the “truth”. <p>Importantly, intuitive insight is not a function of intelligence, yet raw intelligence is the qualification society requires of its teachers. Indeed, surface abilities—physical (e.g., sports), emotional (e.g., arts), intellectual (e.g., science)—are the <u>only measurable</u> human qualities. So naturally, how else is a hierarchical society supposed to judge and rank its citizens? <p><strong><em>People are difficult to govern because they are too intelligent.<br> Therefore, using intelligence to govern the country injures the country.<br> Not using intelligence to govern the country blesses the country.</em></strong> <p>Why are <em>they too intelligent</em>? The first line of chapter 1 says it all: <em><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-1/>The way possible to think, runs counter to the constant way</a></em>, especially when viewed in relation to the first line of chapter 71: <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-71/>Realizing I don’t know is better; not knowing this knowing is disease</a>. Human cognition—intelligence—can’t help but take itself seriously. Our sense of self-worth is intimately linked to what we think we know. The linkage between our sense of self-worth and our knowledge declines slowly as life experience allows us to realize we actually don’t know. This is why aging brings increasing wisdom to <u>everyone</u>, at least compared to their earlier life. <p>Like all animals, survival requires us to respond to the environment—to <em>govern</em> our lives, as it were. Unlike other animals, we believe we make voluntary choices in our actions… we think we are in charge. This sense of agency is the illusionary feeling of being in the driving seat when it comes to our actions. (See <u><a href=/essays/core-issues-of-human-nature/belief/>Belief: Are We Just Fooling Ourselves?</a></u>) This illusion of control is a side-effect of our intelligence. Failing to realize that we don’t know, our actions will invariably lead to unintended consequences. Simply put, our cognitive arrogance is our downfall. This line from chapter 16 sums it up, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-16/>Not knowing the constant, rash actions lead to ominous results</a>. <p>Thus, governing anything, from your own life on up to a country, <em>using intelligence</em> is bound to fail. The ultimate ignorance embedded in knowledge is incapable of managing the full spectrum of life and death. The <em>disease</em> pointed out in chapter 71 guarantees failure in the long run. <p>Governing the broad and deep matters of life benefits from slowing down to tap into our intuitive sense of life. This is the realm of intuitive knowing which we share with <u>all life</u> on Earth. It is the ‘listen to your gut’ or ‘listen to your heart’ beyond words perception of reality. When faced with big decisions, people often experience a battle between their intellect and their gut. I would imagine those who’s intellect wins out are more likely to live to regret it. In the end, intelligence and knowledge are finite, while the intuitive realm is immeasurable. Note: This is not to say the intuitive realm is infallible! Even so, its power lies in how it can plumb reality deeper than any words. <p>Now consider the next line… <em>Not using intelligence to govern the country blesses the country.</em> Free from the pig-headed and often arrogance of intelligence, intuitive perception can take in the ‘big picture’. This has a much better chance of seeing beyond one’s learned knowledge. Naturally, this is difficult, for we rely so heavily on our intelligence to manage life in general. And indeed, intelligence is excellent for managing mundane worldly matters, from hearth surgery and nuclear physics to plumbing and farming. But even these affairs benefit profoundly from being managed in the end by our intuitive realm. <p><strong><em>Know these both and investigate their patterns.<br> Always investigate the patterns.<br> That is called profound moral character.</em></strong> <p><em>Know these both and investigate their patterns</em> is a tacit recognition that <em>intelligence</em> is a vital aspect of human existence. The problem is that we easily, if not lazily, rely on <em>intelligence</em> as the main resource for <em>governing</em> life… too much of a good thing, as it were. <em>Always investigate the patterns</em> is only possible if you’re not passionately choosing to depend on either side—<em>intelligence</em> or intuition. In short, keeping an open mind serves us best. I must say, this feels like a perfect definition of <em>profound moral character.</em> Our <em>disease</em> is what keeps our mind closed off in one way or another. An open mind is only possible if one <em>realizes they don’t know!</em> <p>An open mind notices the nature of things—the environment—in its quest to see beyond itself. Chapter 15 describes this as, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-15/>Of old, the adept student was minutely subtle, profoundly connecting, and deep beyond knowledge</a>. Chapter 52, portrays this journey in more detail, <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-52/>All under heaven had a beginning; consider the origin of all under heaven.<br> Already having this origin, use this to know its offspring.<br> Already knowing its offspring, return to observe the origin.<br> Nearly rising beyond oneself</a>. <p>Clearly, this entails observing without passing moral judgment or projecting one’s expectations on how the world ‘should be’. This boils down to observing life in order to conform to nature as opposed to vying with how things are for some self-centered advantage. As chapter 68 puts this, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-68/>This is called matching of Nature’s ancient utmost</a>. <p><strong><em>Moral character, profound indeed, distant indeed!<br> To the outside world, contrary indeed.<br> Then, and only then, reaching great conformity</em></strong>. <p><em>Moral character, profound indeed, distant indeed! To the outside world, contrary indeed.</em> This certainly highlights the enormity of <em>moral character</em>. <em>Moral character</em> is definitely not something that one can choose to ‘work on’. In my experience, my <em>moral character</em> has deepens as I’ve aged. A good analogy is giving a toddler a bike to ride. He can’t actually ride it until he has learned how to walk. Likewise, we journey through life gradually approaching the peace that comes from <em>reaching great conformity</em>. <p>Now, exactly what does <em>conformity</em> mean here? As a social species, humans innately feel a need to conform. In our ancestral hunter-gather epoch, conformity would happen intuitively with little to none of the hierarchical social pressures found in civilization. Circumstances have changed greatly, yet we all still express this instinct to conform one way or another. Conforming to what and to which extent are the variables here. Intuitive familial conformity is the starting place for all infants, but this soon extends to feeling pressure in relation to cultural conformity. Some conform willingly, some rebel, and a few simply don’t feel the pressure. These eccentrics march to the beat of their own drum. Yet, even these outliers conform to their own idiosyncratic life patterns There is simply no way to escape <em>conformity</em> unless perhaps one has a serious personality disorder. <p>I feel here that <em>reaching great conformity</em> needs some clarification. These three characters here are <em>zhì dà shun </em>( 至大顺 ). The first two translate as “arrive; to; until” + “big; huge; major; great; wide; deep; oldest; eldest”, which I sum up as <em>reaching great</em>. The last character translates as “in the same direction as; with; along; to obey; to follow; to arrange; favorable”, which I sum up as <em>conformity.</em> The <em>great conformity</em> alluded to here <u>is not</u> your typical cultural normal conformity discussed in the last paragraph, and to which some avidly rebel against. Indeed, either conforming to or rebelling against cultural conformity pressures are steps along the way to—and yet often impede—<em>reaching great conformity</em>. <p><em>Reaching great conformity</em> can only begin to occur when our own expectations and ideals cease competing with reality! And that only happens when we genuinely <em>realize we don’t know</em>. That is when, as chapter 3 puts it, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-3/>Doing without doing, following without exception rules</a>. The only path left to follow in life is the one <em>reaching</em> for<em> great conformity</em>. <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter Archive <a href=https://youtu.be/DZhEyx68tao>https://youtu.be/DZhEyx68tao</a><br> This is the complete video.

It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to consider the word-for-word run-down here. <p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ancient</span></b> (age-old) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span></b> <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">good</span></b> (satisfactory; be adept in) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do</span></b> (act; act as; serve as; be; mean; support) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">road</span></b> (way, principle; speak; think) (者), <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">wrong</span></b> (not conform to &lt;infrml&gt; must) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">use</span></b> (&lt;v&gt; take &lt;p&gt; according to; because of &lt;adj&gt; so as to &lt;conj&gt; and) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bright</span></b> (light; clear; open; honest; understand) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the people</span></b> (civilian), [ 古之善为道者，非以明民 ] <p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">support</span></b> (bring; handle, will&gt; lead, command) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">use</span></b> (&lt;v&gt; take &lt;p&gt; according to; because of &lt;adj&gt; so as to &lt;conj&gt; and) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">foolish</span></b> (stupid; make a fool of; fool) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span></b>. [ 将以愚之 ] <p>When considering the first word, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ancient</span></b> (age-old), I wondered what would qualify. This may often be translated/interpreted to mean a person, a sage, an &#8216;enlightened one&#8217;. Heretic that I am, that doesn&#8217;t cut it for me. To me, only Mother Nature truly fits the bill; &#8216;she&#8217; is ancient, age-old. However, that doesn&#8217;t exclude sages and the like… it just places them lower on the totem pole. <p><b>The Bio-Hoodwink</b> <p>I believe these first lines brought me to the idea of the bio-hoodwink. At that time, I was still referencing D.C. Lau&#8217;s translation. He translated these two lines of chapter 65 as <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-65>Of old those who excelled in the pursuit of the way did not use it to enlighten the people but to hoodwink them</a>. <i>Of ancients adept in the way</i>, he put as &#8220;Of old those who excelled in the pursuit of the way&#8221;. Phrasing it that way, makes it easier to read &#8220;those who&#8221; as meaning people primarily (sages and the like). Considering the more literal eliminates that bias, and allows me to consider this in a primordial context… biology! For more on this angle, see <a href=/blog/2010/04/11/how-the-hoodwink-hooks/>How the Hoodwink Hooks</a>. <p>I can see various ways in which this can apply to people as well. However, the question here is, are the people doing the hoodwinking aware that they are doing so. I suspect not. The hoodwinkers are themselves hoodwinked by their own biology. On the other hand, consider the example of the Christmas story. Adults know there is no Santa Claus, but &#8216;hoodwink&#8217; children by maintaining the myth. When the time comes, kids see through the myth; no harm done. <p><b>Karma</b> <p>Another example might be the myth of Karma. The most literal form has us living our lives, dying and being reborn into another life form consequent on the life we previously lived. If that makes one feel a sense of security, whose to say otherwise. On the other hand, a Taoist version of Karma must conform to chapter 1&#8217;s disclaimer, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-1/>The way possible to think, runs counter to the constant way. The name possible to express runs counter to the constant name</a>. <p>I can think of versions of Karma that, in their murkiness, can align better with <i>the constant</i>. For example, the viewpoint that we are all composed of stardust, the existence of which continues after our body dies. Or, the idea that consciousness is universal and continues in the presence of the present. This is similar to chapter 2 of the Bhagavad Gita: &#8220;Invisible before birth are all beings and after death invisible again. They are seen between two unseens. Why in this truth find sorrow?&#8221; These views of Karma pertain to the &#8216;light of consciousness&#8217; behind &#8216;self&#8217;, so to speak, which shines in all things existent and not about the illusion of self (ego) of which we are conscious. That is simply the bio-hoodwink doing its thing; as Buddha pointed out, &#8220;…<a href=/essays/buddhas-four-noble-truths/>the illusion of self originates and manifests itself in a cleaving to things</a>&#8220;. <p><b>Intelligence vs. Wisdom</b> <p>The Line, <i>Not using intelligence to govern the country blesses the country</i>, was confusing to some in the last meeting. Looking at the word-for-word section made it even more so. First, consider the word-for-word for this line. <p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span></b> (not) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">use</span></b> (&lt;v&gt; take &lt;p&gt; according to; because of &lt;adj&gt; so as to &lt;conj&gt; and) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">wisdom</span></b> (intelligence, resourcefulness; wit) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">rule</span></b> (govern; order; peace; &gt; government; control) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">country</span></b>, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">country </span></b><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span></b> <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">good fortune</span></b> (happiness). 不以智治国，国之福。 <p>This illustrates the central problem with word meaning. Much of our own personal experience combines to anchor meaning, which can make word meaning exceedingly subjective. That&#8217;s not a problem in practical matters, where in we refer to concrete objects and events. <i>Wisdom, intelligence, resourcefulness</i>, and <i>wit</i> are another matter; they are qualitative, with much of their meaning biased by personal preferences and experience. <p>What seems wise and intelligent to one can seem foolish and stupid to another. I&#8217;d say that is a good reason for the advice given here. Be extremely leery of what we think of as being intelligent and wise, and avoid using those shifting sands on which to base our approach to life. As chapter 19 says, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-19/>Cut off the sage, discard wisdom, And the people benefit hundred fold.</a> <p><b>Investigate the Patterns</b> <p>If we can&#8217;t rely on wisdom and intelligence to guide us, pray heaven what do we do? <i>Profound moral character</i> is the lock, and <i>investigating the patterns</i> is the key to that lock. The only way to open up one&#8217;s <i>profound moral character</i> is by investigating the patterns that recur in one&#8217;s own life. This is not a static wisdom; it is an ever growing and maturing wisdom. Buddha&#8217;s call to avoid taking anything on hearsay, but rather examine one&#8217;s own experience to verify truth parallels this idea. <p><i>Always investigate the patterns.<br> That is called profound moral character.</i> <p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ordinary</span></b> (normal; constant; often) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">know</span></b> (realize; tell) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">check</span></b> (examine; investigate; procrastinate) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">type</span></b> (style, pattern), 常知稽式，<i>(cháng zhī jī shì,) </i> <p>&lt;grm&gt; <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span></b> (yes &lt;frml&gt; this; that) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">say</span></b> (call; name; meaning; sense) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">black</span></b> (dark; profound) <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">virtue</span></b> (moral character; integrity; heart). 是谓玄德。<i>(Â)</i> <p><i>Moral character, profound indeed, distant indeed!<br> To the outside world, contrary indeed.<br> Then, and only then, reaching great conformity.</i> <p>I leave these last three lines alone, only to say how pregnant with meaning they are… but perhaps not to the &#8216;outside world&#8217;. 😉 <p><b>Correlations: A Way to Investigate the Patterns</b> <p>If you wish to investigate the patterns, try your hand at <a href=/essays/correlations/>Tools of Taoist Thought: Correlations</a>. Chapter four suggests we <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-4/>Subdue its sharpness, separate its confusion</a>. The correlation process aims to <i>subdue the sharpness</i> of word meaning. Subduing the sharpness of any distinction comes through actively looking out for profound sameness. Chapter 56 speaks to the connection between <i>subdue its sharpness</i> and <i>profound sameness</i>: <blockquote><p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-56/>Knower not speak; speaker not know.<br> Subdue its sharpness, untie its tangles,<br> Soften its brightness, be the same as dust,<br> This is called profound sameness.</a> <p>For this reason,<br> Unobtainable and intimate,<br> Unobtainable and distant<br> Unobtainable and favorable<br> Unobtainable and fearful<br> Unobtainable and noble<br> Unobtainable and humble<br> For this reason all under heaven value it.</blockquote> <p>It appears this correlations process is not that inviting. Not doing the process with sufficient rigor turns out to be mind-numbing drudgery. On the other hand, doing the process rigorously challenges one&#8217;s deeply held biases. As a rule, we seek support for our fondly held biases, not an existential test of them. <p>Oh well, so much for correlations! Still, if you&#8217;re interested, here are two posts on the subject <b><a href=/2009/02/14/grinding-out-correlations/ title="Permanent Link to Grinding Out Correlations">Grinding Out Correlations</a></b>, and its follow-up <b><a href=/2009/03/04/correlations-prime-directive/ title="Permanent Link to Correlation’s ‘Prime Directive’">Correlation’s ‘Prime Directive’</a></b>. <h2 class="ttc-pass two">Second Pass: <q>Work in Progress</q> <time>6/12/2012</time></h2> <h3>Issues:</h3> <p>(1) Line 6 begins unnecessarily with &#8220;Knowing&#8221;; why not do the simpler &#8220;Know&#8221;. Okay I will. <p>(2) I always attempt to keep the word order the same as the original, which makes it read a little odd at times. I suppose adding more comas would helps. So, for <i>Profound moral character deeply penetrating </i>I thought to add a comma… <i>Profound moral character<b>(,)</b> deeply penetrating</i>. <p>Not willing to leave well enough alone, I revisited the original, 玄德深矣、远矣！与物反矣。然后乃至大顺。Nuts! I discovered that I had skipped over something useful. I don&#8217;t know why other that this project fries my brain at times. A more direct and complete translation of the last two lines of this chapter would read: <p><i>Moral character, profound indeed, distant indeed!<br> To the outside world contrary indeed.<br> Then, and even, in the same direction.</i> <p>Profound moral character is truly contrary to the outside world, and yet <i>even then</i> both end up in the same direction. Riddled with such paradox (<a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-78/>Straight and honest words seem inside out</a>), Taoism never gets boring, that&#8217;s for sure. The literal <i>and even</i> in the last line is actually a dual character formation—a two characters combination to pinpoint meaning. Separately, the characters are: nǎi (乃) be; so; therefore; only then; you; and zhì (至) to; until; &lt;formal&gt; extremely; most. I feel they convey more meaning separately than together, especially when interpreting zhì (至) to mean <i>reaching</i>. Altogether this gives: <p><i>Moral character, profound indeed, distant indeed!<br> To the outside world contrary indeed.<br> Then and only then, reaching great conformity.</i> <p>Another &#8216;little&#8217; detail cropped up here in <i>&#8216;To the outside world…&#8217; To</i> comes from Yǔ (与) which also means give; offer; grant; get along with; take part in; be on good terms with; help; support; &lt;prep&gt; <i>to;</i> with &lt;conj.&gt; and; together with. While I chose <i>To the outside world… , </i>most any other of these meanings would work. This goes to show how fluid word meaning truly is, and why Taoism holds names and words in such low esteem—low esteem due to the unwarranted certainty we assign them. We desperately seek nail down, with names and words, that which is broad, fluid and <a href=/blog/2010/12/22/beyond-spooky/>interconnected in non locality</a>.We (I) can&#8217;t help it. At least we have a partial antidote: the Taoist point of view. <p>I am also very fond of how D.C. Lau put these last lines: <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-65>Mysterious virtue is profound and far-reaching,<br> But when things turn back it turns back with them.<br> Only then is complete conformity realized.</a> <p>However, &#8220;When things turn back it turns back with them&#8221; is not exactly what I see in the Chinese. Mysterious virtue is contrary to the external world… and yet. That is why I choose <i>Deeply penetrating</i> to describe the moral character necessary to reach great conformity, i.e., that it encompasses both side of the coin—the mysterious and the external world. Still, maybe I&#8217;m just nitpicking! <p>Well as usual, more than word order was at issue here. <p>(3) Another sticky point occurs earlier in line 3 and 4. D.C. Lau puts line 3 as, <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-65>The reason why the people are difficult to govern is that they are too clever.</a> The Chinese is a little more fuzzy. The word in question here is zhì (智) which translates as, wisdom; resourcefulness; wit. Wisdom is the odd man out here. <p>Consider these dua-words (i.e., Chinese words that come in pairs to help pinpoint meaning). Notice the position of zhì (智 – wisdom; resourcefulness; wit) in each. Zhìshù (<b>智</b>术) is trickery; stratagem. Míngzhì (明<b>智</b>) is sensible; sagacious; wise. The other character is 术 and 明 respectively. Shù 术 means skill; technique; method; tactics. Míng 明 means bright, clear, open, explicit, honest, understand, know, and is the word translated in line one as <i>enlighten</i>. <p>D.C. Lau&#8217;s word <i>clever</i> may not portray the point well. Clever, in Chinese, is lì 俐. Look closely and you&#8217;ll see this character is composed of two radicals (distinct &#8216;sub characters&#8217;). The one on the left side (亻) means man, person. On the right is lì (利) which means, sharp; favorable; advantage; profit; interest. <p>Whew, I&#8217;m going a very long way to say, cleverness is not the problem we face. Animals are clever! The uniquely human qualities of intelligence, wit, resourcefulness (智) are what get us into trouble. <p>That zhì (智) is translated as wisdom is false (perhaps understandably so). Wisdom, in my view, depicts a much deeper sense of life. Wisdom is the perspective that sees beyond one&#8217;s immediate needs and fears. Animals possess such wisdom as well. It is that with which a life of living leaves each creature. How much depend upon circumstance and what it brings to the table genetically. One doesn&#8217;t choose to be wise; one can&#8217;t teach others wisdom. Only the life one lives can do that. <p>By the way, the Chinese word, often used in the Tao Te Ching, is shèngrén (圣人) which means wise man / person. Shèng (圣) means holy, pure, sage, saint. All in all, I have to say this just shows the vague sense culture may generally have about what wisdom is. By the time you start accumulating it, you are on your way out. We learn language in our youth when experience can&#8217;t inform the deeper meaning of a word like wisdom. Even later, wisdom only receives lip service, generally. Intelligence, wit, and resourcefulness are the trophies cultures seek. (However, as the mean age of the population ages that will change.) <h3>Commentary:</h3> <p>I imagine the <b>Issues</b> section above contains enough commentary for one day. I also imagine this is much more than anyone want to read/here. Oh well&#8230; <p>This has always been a favorite chapter of mine. It took me a while to appreciate, <i>Of ancients adept in the way, none ever use it to enlighten people, They will use it in order to fool them. </i>It always seemed so contrary to mainstream ideals. I mean, isn&#8217;t <i>enlightening people</i> the whole trust of civilization from religion on down? This view only really fell into place after I finally realized that <a href=/blog/2011/07/09/you-know/>we can only truly understand what we already know</a>. Like I said, it takes a lifetime. Alas, I expect <i>reaching great conformity</i> takes more than a lifetime. So I had better get busy! <p>Finally, just a few words on the idea of <i>always investigate the patterns.</i> I doing this by regarding everything I see as being an <a href=/blog/2010/09/04/tao-as-emergent-property/>emergent property of something more indistinct and shadowy</a>. It helps me tie the loose ends of apparent chaos together. If you don&#8217;t require the &#8216;ties&#8217; to be clearly labeled, then <i>always investigate the patterns</i> works really well. <h3>Suggested Revision:</h3> <p><i>Of ancients adept in the way, none ever use it to enlighten people,<br> They will use it in order to fool them.<br> People are difficult to govern because they are too intelligent.<br> Therefore, using intelligence to govern the country injures the country.<br> Not using intelligence to govern the country blesses the country.<br> <b>Know</b> these both and investigate their patterns.<br> Always investigate the patterns.<br> That is called profound moral character<b>(.)</b><br> <b>Moral character, profound indeed, distant indeed!<br> To the outside world, contrary indeed.<br> Then, and only then, reaching great conformity.</b></i> <h2 class="one ttc-pass">First Pass: <q>Chapter of the Week</q> <time>03/11/2011</time></h2> <p>Nothing is more &#8216;<em><a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-65>of old and excels in pursuit of the way</a>&#8216; </em> than nature. That nature <em><a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-65>hoodwinks</a></em> living creatures to bring about instinctive interaction has become utterly obvious to me now. I first realized nature was tricking me when I began examining my irrational, lustful, attraction to women. Or course, I knew about this intellectually ever since biology class in high school. But this went deeper. <p>The difference here was the dawning of a visceral intuitive sense of these natural forces acting on me. It was quite liberating to see the puppeteer pulling the strings! Curiously it took another few decades to truly appreciate how extensive this hoodwink really is. Truth be told, I am still in awe. Why did it take so long? <p>Wishful thinking blinded me for decades. I cherished the illusion that I could be the masters of my fate. Civilization and education shielded me from the harsh wild side of Mother Nature, which still further convinced me that I could outwit her. Simply put, <a href=/blog/2011/02/18/the-story-trumps-truth/>my story was what I wanted to hear</a>. <p>We&#8217;ve all heard the brain-wash talking point: &#8220;Animals merely respond through blind instinct; we can <em>intelligently</em> rise above instinct&#8221;. Alas, we are intoxicated by our own <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-18>cleverness</a>, believing we can get away with &#8220;murder&#8221; without consequences. Our excessive intelligence makes us a difficult species for nature <em>to govern</em>. We are like spoiled children, and like them, are not happier for it either. <p>And like children, <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-51>circumstances bring us to maturity</a>. Maturity affords us enough self honesty to begin to see underlying <em>patterns</em>. The issues of life: battles, arguments, attraction and aversion, gain and loss, worries, etc., all have their individual &#8216;color&#8217;. <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-65>Knowing the model </a>that underpins these seemingly disparate events offers us a way to <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-64>deal with a thing while it is still nothing</a> by downplaying the &#8216;color&#8217;. <p>Noticing underlying patterns &#8212; the common denominator &#8212; is another way of describing <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-56>mysterious sameness</a>. <em>Knowing and investigate the pattern,</em> the constant, that connects life&#8217;s disparate issues is called <em>profound moral character</em> given that it becomes less possible to deceive one&#8217;s self through self-rationalization / justification. How do we know <em>mysterious sameness</em> when we see it? That&#8217;s simple: <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-16>impartiality</a> increases and <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-18>hypocrisy</a> drops off. <p>Alas, nature hoodwinks us into seeing sameness as boring and differences as interesting and exciting. It is easier and more fun to know one side of the coin (or the other). <em>Knowing these both and investigate their patterns</em> as a whole is not. Indeed, history is replete with folks passionately aligning themselves to one side or the another. Nothing ever changes; it just goes round and round. On the other hand, the more one sees the whole, the more <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-65>complete conformity</a> becomes the only way. <p><em>Reaching great conformity</em> is also another way of saying to <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-21>follow the way and the way only</a>. <em>Conformity</em> to each moment as it happens is difficult for we tend to project (<a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-71>think</a>) our fears and needs ahead to the next moment. We struggle to control and lead life, rather than follow life. Imagined fear drives us to over protect ourselves from that which will not happen, and ironically, distract us from dangers ever present.</div> <div class="now-what to-dclau"><a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-65>Go to <em>D.C.
