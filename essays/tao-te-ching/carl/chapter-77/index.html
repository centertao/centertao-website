The shorter first part of the meeting begins with a chapter reading followed by attendees’ <u>commentary</u>, if any. A little later on begins the longer <u>open discussion</u> part of the meeting when those who wish to discuss how the chapter relates to their personal experience. <h3>Corrections?</h3> <p>None this time. <h3>Reflections:</h3> <p><strong><em>The way of nature is like a stretching bow.<br> The high restrains, the lower lifts.<br> The surplus decreases, the insufficient benefits.<br> The way of nature decreases surplus yet benefits the insufficient.</em></strong> <p>These first four lines convey a balanced, albeit subtle, picture of nature. As the fourth line concludes, <em>The way of nature decreases surplus yet benefits the insufficient.</em> This is the fundamental nature of entropy—taking from a <em>surplus</em> to give to the <em>insufficient</em>. Essentially, this is the essence of death of both organic and non-organic existences. As chapter 40 put it, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-40/>Loss through death, of the way uses</a>. <p style="padding-left: 40px;">We can apply this facet of nature—<em>decreases surplus yet benefits the insufficient—</em>to any practical matter. A useful and straightforward example that applies to everyone is sarcopenia, a natural age-related progressive loss of muscle mass and strength. Overall, sarcopenia is associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality, so this <em>way of nature</em> is relevant for anyone wishing to improve their health span and life span as much as possible. <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Your body must biologically know you are <u>serious</u> before it will begin to <em>decrease surplus</em> of protein to <em>benefit the insufficiency </em>of muscle. This also applies to bone density and joint flexibility, but the muscle side of this is most clear-cut. <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Youthful energy (fear, need) is <u>serious</u> enough to drive muscle growth and its maintenance. As you age into midlife and beyond, this innate energy (fear, need) gradually decreases. During this time, you just maintain your life’s mellower routine, which sounds comfortable at first glance. <p style="padding-left: 40px;">However, the progressive mellowing down as you age initiates gradual muscle loss. The body senses you no longer <u>seriously</u> need as much muscle as you did in youth, and so begins <em>decreasing surplus,</em> and uses the recycled proteins in other ways. This can happen so gradually over years that it is comparatively unnoticeable. <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Once we realize this decline in health span, most of us would probably wish to reverse course. Here lies the hitch: Our wish must be backed up with raw will—a visceral <em><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-33/>Striving to be current is will</a></em>, as chapter 33 puts it. Resistance exercise and braving the elements is the only way to reverse or at least slow down this process. However, as we age we become more mellow and more sensitive to discomfort (heat, cold), which together make it difficult to be <u>serious</u> enough to make the necessary effort. <p style="padding-left: 40px;">The body (i.e., biology) must know you are deadly <u>serious</u> and not just indulging in wishful thinking. True recovery is driven by a genuine sense of necessity, not desire (i.e., desire = need + thought). This <em>way of nature</em> is the foundation underpinning all life functions, not just muscle. (See <a href=/2015/02/08/fear-need-born-in-nothing/>Fear &amp; Need Born in Nothing</a> and <a href=/2012/07/06/necessity-the-mother/>Necessity, the Mother</a>.) <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Finally, one may wonder why natural evolution set us up for this age-induced decline. It actually didn’t, at least to the extent humanity experiences it. All animals evolved to live in balance with nature’s demands, and so for our distant ancestors, many of humanity’s current problems were usually non-existent. We humans arrogantly, albeit naively, sidestepped nature’s more uncomfortable wild side. This unavoidably brought about the deep-seated imbalances we see throughout civilization. (See <a href=/2017/01/04/the-tradeoff/>The Tradeoff</a>). Undoubtedly, rebalance can only occur by welcoming more discomfort into life. As I like to say, “Short-term pain nurtures long-term pleasure”. <p>From here on this chapter comes across with a somewhat moralistic slant. The end of the last line <em>how odd! </em>sums this up, at least for me. <p><strong><em>The way of man, as a rule however, decreases the insufficient so as to give to the surplus.<br> Who can have a surplus and give to all under heaven?</em></strong> <p>The <em>way of man</em> is actually no different from the <em>way of nature</em>, despite our stories that consistently bury that reality. Such idealistic moral stories like the fifth line, <em>The way of man, as a rule however, decreases the insufficient so as to give to the surplus</em>, are undoubtedly an attempt to compensate for the lopsided consequences of civilization (again, see <a href=/2017/01/04/the-tradeoff/>The Tradeoff</a>). The simple truth is this: if one is content, one’s actions naturally reflect contentment, and thus never would <em>decrease the insufficient so as to give to the surplus.</em> Conversely, when we feel discontent, we are feeling <em>insufficient </em>and so scurry around to fill that inner void with whatever <em>surplus</em> we feel will do the trick, which is <u>the</u> natural process for all life! <p>We notice the imbalances in society and ourselves and feel a strong need to correct them. Our belief that we have a uniquely human ability to control circumstances plays right into this urge to fix the problem. Interestingly, our belief in this ability to control becomes the irrefutable “proof” that we have control. This is one of the ironic aspects of belief; belief in something becomes the “proof” of that something—no evidence required. Blinding faith is all the “evidence” we need. (See <u><a href=/essays/core-issues-of-human-nature/free-will/>Free Will: Fact or Wishful Thinking?</a></u>) The sixth line, <em>Who can have a surplus and give to all under heaven</em> is the perfect example of our ‘cart before the horse’ view of nature. Only when we feel an inner <em>surplus</em> are we able to <em>give to all under heaven</em>, as it were. Simply put, natural processes operate throughout all species, including our own. <p>It is easy to notice how some people have great surplus. It is also easy to be oblivious to the underlying forces at play here. I’d call this an illusion of “objectivity”. This chapter is saying that those with an ostensible surplus, <em>as a rule however, decrease the insufficient so as to give to the surplus.</em> This demonstrates the very misleading characteristic of so-called “objective perception”. Indeed, objectivity is rooted in subjectivity. What we feel and think are simply inner biological/psychological forces skewing our judgments on reality. Essentially, all we perceive is but a mirror of our own inner reality—our needs and fears. Considering the goings on in life from a symptoms point of view (see <u><a href=/blog/2010/11/22/a-symptoms-point-of-view/>Symptoms Point Of View</a></u>) helps step back from our own emotional agenda and see what may lie beneath the surface. <p>In this case, anyone who <em>decreases the insufficient so as to give to the surplus </em>is actually feeling <em>the insufficient</em>—the void—within. Feeling <em>insufficient</em> (loss, empty, insecure, hunger, etc.) they can’t help but grasp after their treasured ‘something’ until they viscerally feel they have reached <em>the surplus.</em> Of course, that doesn’t end this cyclic process of nature. Indeed, adding more on to life can’t nullify the entropic void within. Yet, the emotions (fear and need) will always shout out otherwise. Chapter 46 pulls us back to the simple truth… <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-46/>Therefore, in being contented with one’s lot, enough is usually enough indeed</a>. Thus, those who <em>decrease the insufficient so as to give to the surplus</em> are actually experiencing the <em>insufficient</em> within. The grasping after only ceases when one feels more inner <em>sufficiency</em>—the inner cup spilleth over! <p><strong><em>Only those who have the way</em></strong>. <p>This is a blatantly shallow and hierarchical view of <em>the way</em>, and goes against the spirit of chapter 73’s <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-73/>Nature’s net is vast and thin, yet never misses</a>. In other words, what in all of creation does not ‘<em>have the way</em>’? Such hierarchical and moralistic viewpoints creep into the Tao Te Ching quite rarely—fortunately. This is a sobering reminder that being as <em>impartial</em> as nature is virtually impossible for any living organism. As chapter 16 ends, <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-16/>Knowing the constant allows, allowing therefore impartial,<br> Impartial therefore whole, whole therefore natural,<br> Natural therefore the way.<br> The way therefore long enduring, nearly rising beyond oneself.</a> <p>Life does not permit us to be totally <em>impartial</em>, and so even approaching <em>impartiality</em> is truly <em>nearly rising beyond oneself.</em> I find it more than sufficient to face up to and accept my impartiality, and bravely admit I am simply a fragile and fleeting artifact of nature. As chapter 76 put it, <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-76/>Of people, existence weak and delicate</a>. <p><strong>The holy person uses this to serve, yet does not rely on,<br> Meritorious deeds result, yet not dwelled within.</strong> <p>Here again, these two lines put the cart somewhat before the horse. The need to <em>rely on</em> ‘something’ is simply a symptom of the insufficiency of that ‘something’. These lines imply that those <em>who have the way</em> have no insufficiency. In reality, feeling insufficiency is the baseline for all living creatures. Thus, the whole idea of any living thing as not <em>having the way</em> as moralistic and absurd. Take chapter 34’s <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-34/>The great way flows, such as it may left and right. All things on earth depend on it for existence, yet it never declines</a> or chapter 73’s <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-73/>Nature’s net is vast and thin, yet never misses</a>. This is rather a simple case of internal imbalance—the lack of homeostasis—with the deficit driving a need to rely on ‘something’ missing. This is natural, no different from how hunger drives living things to seek out nourishment. Life is a pendulum, swinging between sufficiency and insufficiency. <p>Thus, the only time one <em>dwells within</em> their so-called <em>meritorious deeds</em> is when they feel a deficit, i.e., social insecurity and in need of self-affirmation or increased higher status in the social hierarchy. Any claims made about one’s virtue or meritorious deeds are a symptom of their need to bolster their self-image. Fear (entropy, loss, insecurity) drives us to compensate in myriad ways in our pursuit of inner psychological homeostasis—balance. <p><strong>Such absence of desire appears able and virtuous &#8211; how odd!</strong> <p>I find it quite true that the more absent my <em>desire</em>, the more <em>able</em> I am to deal with circumstances in the most balanced, graceful, and <em>virtuous</em> way. Indeed, <em>desires</em> and expectations are the main roadblocks to <em>virtuous</em> action. Clearly, this means that <em>virtuous</em> action is not a reality, but rather an ideality. Fear and need (desire) are the motivation forces that propel life to live and act. Chapter 38 puts virtue in perspective, although it still ends from a somewhat ‘cart before the horse’ point of view. <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-38/>Superior virtue is not virtuous, and so has virtue.<br> Inferior virtue never deviates from virtue and so is without virtue.<br> Superior virtue never acts and never believes.<br> Inferior virtue never acts yet believes.<br> Superior benevolence acts yet never believes.<br> Superior justice acts and believes.<br> Superior etiquette acts but when none respond,<br> Normally roles up its sleeves and throws away.<br> Hence, Virtue follows loss of way.<br> Benevolence follows loss of virtue.<br> Justice follows loss of benevolence.<br> Ritual follows loss of justice.<br> Ways of chaos follow loss of loyalty and thinning faith in ritual.<br> Foreknowledge of the way, magnificent yet a beginning of folly.<br> The great man dwells in the thick, not in the thin.<br> Dwells in the true, not in the magnificent.<br> Hence, he leaves that and takes this.</a> <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter Archive <a href=https://youtu.be/I75py_zxBos>https://youtu.be/I75py_zxBos</a><br> This is the complete video. It begins with blowing Zen followed by the meeting <h2 class="three ttc-pass">Third Pass: <q>Chapter of the Month</q> <time>3/19/2016</time></h2> <h3>Corrections?</h3> <p>None per se… <h3>Reflections:</h3> <p><em>Who can have a surplus and give to all under heaven? Only he who has the way</em>. Well then, all I need to <strong><u>do</u></strong> is figure out how to get <em>the way</em>. Sarcastic yes, yet still a good blunt line of attack. It is utterly normal to think I can <strong><u>do</u></strong> something to get <em>the way</em>. Alas, that approach always ends up getting in my way. <p>Feeling and then thinking I can <strong><u>do</u></strong> something to get <em>the way</em> illustrates the difference between <a href=/essays/core-issues-of-human-nature/free-will/>free will notions</a> and <em>the way</em>. I think of <em>the way</em> as an infinite bowl of space time in which all of existence circulates within. Everything is in-by-with-of-on <em>the way</em>; this is my objective metaphor. However, it is a subjective sense of having <em>the way</em> for which I yearn. Why? Because I assume ‘it’ will make me happier. Doesn’t this ring the bell of Buddha’s “<a href=/essays/buddhas-four-noble-truths/>The surrounding world affects sensation and begets a craving thirst that clamors for immediate satisfaction</a>”. <p>The intention to <strong><u>do</u></strong> something, anything, in order to have <em>the way</em> causes the problem that I’m wishing to resolve. It is utterly futile. The bright side of this dismal circumstance is that by facing up to it, I am able to look deeper within to tab other resources. Consider the Bhagavad Gita and its view of surrender for example. <blockquote><p>But they for whom I am the End Supreme, who surrender all their works to me, and who with pure love meditate on me and adore me ‑ these I very soon deliver from the ocean of death and life‑in‑death, because they have set their heart on me. 12:6‑7 <p>For concentration is better than mere practice, and meditation is better than concentration; but higher than meditation is surrender in love of the fruit of one&#8217;s actions, for on surrender follows peace. 12:12 <p>The renunciation of selfish works is called renunciation; but the surrender of the reward of all work is called surrender. 8:2</blockquote> <p>So, all I need to <strong><u>do</u></strong> is surrender! Yes and no. I must surrender in order to relax or fall asleep. Yet, if I try to let go and surrender, I just lie awake trying to <strong><u>do</u></strong> it. Cease trying to <strong><u>do</u></strong> is what works, but I can’t try to cease the <strong><u>doing</u></strong>. <h4>Wéi Wú Wéi or Wú Wéi (为无为 or 无为)</h4> <p>You probably see where I’m headed with this. I hope I’ve helped take the moralistic connotation with which people habitually interpret this chapter. A blinding belief in free will, whether explicit or implied, lends this chapter the righteous angle implied in <strong>lines 5,6, </strong>and <strong>7</strong>. Indeed, I’d even go so far as to say the author, Lao Tzu or others, made this blunder. Well, nobody’s perfect! <p>5) <em>The way of man, as a rule however, decreases the insufficient so as to give to the surplus.</em><br> 6) <em>Who can have a surplus and give to all under heaven?</em><br> 7) <em>Only those who have the way. </em> <p>Any such misreading of Nature, in my view, is due to failing to examine circumstances from <a href=/blog/2010/11/22/a-symptoms-point-of-view/>a symptoms point of view</a>. Instead, our faulty judgments arise from an innate sense of fairness common to ‘higher’ social animals. Simply put, primal emotion drives human cognition. <strong>Line 4</strong> gives us a clue to seeing outside this instinct driven box: (4) <em><u>The way of nature decreases surplus yet benefits the insufficient.</u></em> <p>Chapter 56’s <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-56/>This is called profound sameness</a> and to chapter 16’s <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-16/>Knowing the constant allows, allowing therefore impartial</a> also helps clear away moralistic connotation. <p><em>The way of nature</em> doesn’t just take a vacation when it comes to humanity. Therefore, whenever <em>the way of man, as a rule however, decreases the insufficient so as to give to the surplus</em> is true, <u>it is still nature at work!</u> In other words, when a person is piling up <em>surplus</em>, for example, they are merely feeling a profound <em>insufficiency</em> within themselves, i.e., emptiness, loss, failure, weakness, death and all the other <a href=/essays/correlations/>correlates</a>. They can’t help but <em>decreases surplus </em>they see ‘out there’ to <em>benefits the insufficiency</em> they are experiencing within themselves. After all, ‘in here’ is our core point of reference for what is real. I suppose that’s why sanity can be so precarious. <h4>Free will and <em>wéi wú wéi </em>are like oil and water</h4> <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-3/>Doing without doing, following without exception rules.</a> <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-63/>Do without doing, Be involved without being involved.</a> <p>Much of the Tao Te Ching appears to be telling us to do something, like <em>be involved without being involved</em> and much of the rest of chapter 63 and 3. In some cases, like this current chapter 77, it seems the author/s is doing just that. In other cases, the author/s pleads a case for <em>without doing</em>. I resolve the seeming inconsistencies by simply regarding the Tao Te Ching as a very keen view of how nature works, and not as a prescription of what I ‘should do’, had I free will to choose. <p>Viewing the Tao Te Ching as a description rather than as a proscription is actually an effective way to nudge myself in the ‘Right Direction’, as Buddha might have called it. The more deeply I sense how nature works, the more involuntarily I seem to comply cognitively speaking. I can’t help it. It becomes harder to expect otherwise, and as we know, it is cleaving to our expectations that grieve us most! Surrendering expectations — <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-68/>This is called matching of Nature’s ancient utmost.</a> <p>Here are chapters that speak just to ‘without doing’ &#8211; <em>wú wéi</em> ( 无为 )<br> Chapter <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-10/>10</a>; Chapter <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-37/>37</a>; Chapter <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-38/>38</a>; Chapter <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-43/>43</a>; Chapter <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-48/>48</a>; Chapter <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-57/>57</a>; Chapter <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-64/>64</a>. <h2 class="ttc-pass two">Second Pass: <q>Work in Progress</q> <time>9/29/2012</time></h2> <h3>Issues:</h3> <p>Just a few little touch-ups for this chapter. They are bolded in the suggested revision below. <h3>Commentary:</h3> <p>For me, <i>The way of nature is like a stretching bow</i>, speaks to the most obvious quality of nature that exists without exception—balance. This occurs as static balance or as dynamic balance. Perhaps an underappreciated aspect of dynamic balance is the unbalances that <i>balance</i> balance. I mean, perfect balance would be, in my view, unbalanced. You know… if everything was in balance&#8217;s corner, then poor old unbalance&#8217;s corner would be empty non-existence. If anything, I suppose such empty non-existence would be the <i>constant</i> balance, i.e., <a href=/tao-te-ching/carl/chapter-1/>The way possible to think, runs counter to the constant way</a>. The states of balance I can envision or actually see don&#8217;t meet this fundamental Taoist benchmark. The constant is like the last reflection in a succession of infinite succession of mirrored reflections. <p>So what is it with us that <i>as a rule however, decreases the insufficient so as to give to the surplus? </i>You&#8217;ve probably guessed it: <b>it&#8217;s thought</b>. In having a large part of our sensations of exist in a mind-made virtual reality, it is easy to get out of kilter balance-wise. We imagine loss, death, failure off in the future. Sure, all these are certain to be future realities at some point. However, our thoughts highjack our emotions and lead us to feel this imagined reality (more or less) current reality. <p>The more we feel our imagined reality is &#8216;certain&#8217; reality, the more out of balance we become with the actual reality in and of the moment. The forever-haunting presence of this trait probably blinds us to its prevalence, if not very existence. I know it took me many decades to appreciate fully its blinding power! Although, perhaps I&#8217;m just dumber than most. <h3>Suggested Revision:</h3> <p><i>The way of nature is like a stretching bow.</i><br> <i>The high restrains<b>(,)</b> the lower lifts.</i><br> <i>The surplus decreases, the insufficient benefits.</i><br> <i>The way of nature decreases surplus<b>(,)</b> yet benefits the insufficient.</i><br> <i>The way of man, as a rule however, decreases the insufficient so as to give to the surplus.</i><br> <i>Who can have a surplus and give to all under heaven?</i><br> <i>Only those who have the way.</i><br> <i>The holy <b>person</b> uses this to serve, yet does not rely on,</i><br> <i>Meritorious deeds result, yet not dwelled within.</i><br> <i>Such absence of desire <b>appears</b> able and virtuous &#8211; how odd!</i> <h2 class="one ttc-pass">First Pass: <q>Chapter of the Week</q> <time>09/20/2011</time></h2> <p>Once in awhile the Tao Te Ching falls into what I&#8217;d call a &#8216;humanist&#8217; trap. This lends support to the view than the Tao Te Ching is really the product of more than one thinker / author. Perhaps too, the ‘taoist&#8217; point of view was passed down via aural tradition over generations before being finally written down. (It&#8217;s so long ago; I forgot 😉 ) <p>The view here that &#8216;<a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-77>It is the way of heaven to take from what has in excess in order to make good what is deficient. The way of man is otherwise</a>&#8216; runs contrary to the broader view expressed in chapter 34… <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-34>The way is broad, reaching left as well as right</a>. <p>Even more at odds with this chapter is chapter 25, which in my view, expresses a simple rendering of the <a href=/blog/2010/09/04/tao-as-emergent-property/>emergent properties principle</a>. Chapter 25 ends with: <p><a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-25>Man models himself on earth,<br> Earth on heaven,<br> Heaven on the way,<br> And the way on that which is naturally so</a>. <p>I can only guess that our species&#8217; fairness instinct (see <a href=/wp-content/uploads/unfair-trade_-monkeys-demand.pdf>our fairness instinct</a>) drives the egalitarian bias obvious in chapter 77. This sense of equality and fairness underlies so much (perhaps most) of our behavior, I suspect. I now deem this to be a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">major influence</span> in every facet of life<sup>(1)</sup>. <p>Indeed, this chapter expresses a sense of what I call implied <a href=/essays/core-issues-of-human-nature/free-will/>free will</a>. It is subtly expressed here, for instance, by: <em>The way of nature decreases surplus yet benefits the insufficient. The way of man, as a rule however, decreases the insufficient so as to give to the surplus</em>. The implication is that mankind somehow has a choice in the matter. It seems to imply that mankind could act more &#8220;naturally&#8221; than it does if it chose to. This view puts the cart before the horse (or rather the man before the biology). <p>The way I see it, an animal (including us) does what it does out of innate need and fear. What is the real reason that <em>the way of man, as a rule however, decreases the insufficient so as to give to the surplus? </em>Chapter 22 sheds light on this indirectly: <p><em><a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-22>He does not show himself, and so is conspicuous;<br> He does not consider himself right, and so is illustrious;<br> He does not brag, and so has merit;<br> He does not boast, and so endures.</a></em> <p>Here, the view is that by not bragging he has merit; by no boasting he endures; by not considering himself right, he is illustrious. Again, the cart is before the horse<sup>(2)</sup>. My experience is just the other way around. The more I feel inner merit, the less I tend to brag; the more illustrious I feel, the less I need to consider myself right, and so on. <p>Similarly, the more <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-33>contentment</a> I feel, the less I <em>decrease the insufficient so as to give to the surplus. </em>It is out of need (visceral hunger) that greedy action arises. Greed is a symptom of not being content; greed is a natural consequence of <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-46>not being content</a>. Not being content drives animals, including us, to do what they do &#8211; period. The trick to balanced living is not shooting oneself in the foot. This entails doing that which has the best chance to make us feel more content; with contentment we naturally <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-2>keep to the deed that consists in taking no action and practice the teaching that uses no words.</a> Ah yes, all this is so <a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-70>very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice, yet</a>… <p><sup>(1)</sup> So, how do I know I&#8217;m not just projecting some need to see &#8220;the fairness instinct&#8221; as one of nature&#8217;s master puppeteers? I don&#8217;t really. On the other hand, I don&#8217;t really care if I&#8217;m right or wrong. Ironically this may make it more likely that I&#8217;m seeing &#8216;it&#8217; as &#8216;it&#8217; is. In any case, people have no trouble seeing instinct as the driving force in animal life. It&#8217;s just in human life where people balk at the idea. Somehow we desire to see ourselves &#8220;superior&#8221; to other animals and blessed with free will, free choice. <p><sup>(2)</sup> The way this is stated, i.e., &#8220;He does not brag, and so has merit”, is accurate in the sense that this is how we tend to perceive it. Meaning, when someone doesn&#8217;t brag we regard them in a more meritorious light. This &#8216;judging a book by its cover&#8217; is a key bio-hoodwink that often trips us up.</div> <div class="now-what to-dclau"><a href=/tao-te-ching/dc-lau/#chapter-77>Go to <em>D.C.
